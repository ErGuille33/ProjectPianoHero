<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Piano Unite

Piano Unite is a tool, created by Guillermo Sánchez de Lamadrid, that enables teachers and students to work on elemental piano lessons. Teachers will be able to create customized exercises for their students, while students will learn as they play. 

Piano Unite is able to evaluate performance on each of the exercises and will reward the student's progress. In addition, you will be able to import any MIDI file to use it as a new game level.

To use this tool optimally, you must connect a MIDI keyboard to your computer.

There are two versions, one for teachers (Alumno version) and one for students (Profesor version). This application is written completely in Spanish and it is compatible with Windows 7, 10 and 11.

This tool was created as part of a bachelor thesis for the UCM (Universidad Complutense de Madrid).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Sections of Interest

Inside the directory "..\Assets\PianoScene\Scripts" you can find "MidiFile.cs" and "MidiRecorder.cs". This two scripts can be reused in order to read and write MIDI files, and convert them to a series of events wich can be used in any rythm game.
